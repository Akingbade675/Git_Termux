Buhari To Decide On UTAS And Others For ASUU To End Strike

To guide the President in taking a decision, the inter-ministerial departments and agencies committees of the Federal Government will turn in their reports on Wednesday.

The reports of the committees could bring an end to the four-month old strike embarked on by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU).

ASUU began a one-month strike in February which was extended at the expiration by two-month.

The union further extended the strike by another three months to give the government ample time to meet its demands.
